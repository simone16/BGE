I'm going to take you to the bank, Senator Trent. The blood bank!
He had to split.
You're the disease, and I'm the cure.
Are you gonna do something, or just stand there and bleed?
Sounds like you've had a hard life. Good thing it's over.
I think he got the point.
I don't believe I'll be having that beer just now. Not unless I'm drinking it from Jonah King's skull.
He met his Waterloo.
Why? Because it feels so goddamn good!
You ever play roulette? Well, let me give you a word of advice: Always bet on black.
Maybe, but it's legal.
Saves time.
I want a bloody costume!
All those feathers, and he still can't fly.
That's 'cause I've been drinking, bitch!
If you come back in here, I'm gonna hit you with so many rights, you're gonna beg for a left.
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates for me to kill?
If they move, kill 'em.
Son, your bystanding days are over! You're in it now, up to your neck!
Leo the Fart is gonna pass gas one more time.
By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and knife.
I told him that cigarette would kill him one day.
Then what good are you?
It just be raining black people in New York!
Backseat driver!
Out here, due process is a bullet.
That's all you'll ever need!
Welcome to Scotland!
I like the way you die, boy.
Let's give them something to drink!
Eat your vegetables!
There is no Spoon.
Respect for my elders!
Consider that a divorce.
No thanks, I've already had a wife.
Welcome to Earth!
Dodge this!
Don't call me Junior!
Just being disarming, darling.
Are you a Mexican or a Mexi-can't?
It's just been revoked.
Dyin' ain't much of a livin', boy.
Sit tight, hold the fort, keep the home fires burning. And if we're not back by dawn, call the president.
Get off my plane!
Best $1.80 I ever spent!
F**k 'em.
Forgiveness is between them and God. My job's to arrange the meeting.
Dolemite is my name, and f**kin' up muthaf**kas is my game!
Let's face it, this is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
And you go in pieces, a**hole!
I never miss.
Is that the best you can do, you pansies?
Isn't that just like a wop? Brings a knife to a gunfight.
You're luggage.
Well, I only bring it up because, uh, it's you. You're the Rocket Man.
You believe in Jesus? Well, you're gonna meet him.
She had her kicks.
How do you like your ribs?
My little contribution to birth control.
Some motherf**kers are always trying to ice-skate uphill.
You're terminated, f**ker!
You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't ya? Practice!
I'm Canadian.
Yeah, I don't sit in chairs as well as I used to.
Yeah? Well, I'm taller.
Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.
Now the whole world is going to know that you died scratching my balls!
I don't step on toes, Littlejohn. I step on necks.
Smile, you son of a--
You're fired.
You know what I am? I'm your worst f**kin' nightmare, man. I'm a n***er with a badge. That means I got permission to kick your f**kin' ass whenever I feel like it!
Well, he certainly left with his tail between his legs.
You're discharged, Sarge.
He had a lot of guts.
Second date -- no tongue!
Stick around!
We came, we saw, we kicked its ass!
Disturbing the peace? I got thrown out of a window! What's the f**king charge for getting pushed out of a moving car, huh? Jaywalking?
I guess I should have told him to freeze.
I hope not, 'cause I'm thinking how much my balls hurt.
She always did enjoy a good squeeze.
That's a cute outfit. Did your husband give it to you?
You're gonna regret this the rest of your life -- both seconds of it.
They'll print anything these days.
This is the 90s. You can't just walk up and slap a guy. You have to say something cool first.
Boy, and I thought insurance salesmen were pushy.
Just your mother!
You're a dick.
Thanks for the advice.
No, but I know how you got these!
Go ahead. Make my day.
Say hello to my little friend!
Well, give the man a hand!
Puny god.
Well, hello, Mr. Fancy Pants! I've got news for you, pal. You ain't leading but two things right now: Jack and S**t. And Jack left town.
I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubble gum.
Shocking. Positively shocking.
Let off some steam, Bennett!
